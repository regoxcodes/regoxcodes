Hey there! 👋

I'm Niraya, a design engineer based in Germany.

I design and build whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is react, typescript, tailwind, and framer motion. My favorite tools are figma, notes.

I've got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is the Discord Support Bot.

I'm new in this field so rn learning.

If you want to learn how i do it, my books and course are available here!


Fun Facts:

• I have 3 dogs
• I love coffee and tea
• Baki Hanma is my fav anime
• Hobbies: anime, gym, building things
